<h3> Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) </h3>
  <p> Gunpowder was one of the key inventions in the Song dynasty, originally used for fireworks. However, as time passed it was able to be used for weaponry in various conflicts.</p>
  <p> Another key innovation was the use of Champa rice, a crop that could be harvested much more quickly as opposed to regular crops, allowing for a quick boost in the conomic structure through trade and markets. </p>
